    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph databases are designed to represent data as nodes interconnected with edges, which respectively model entities and their relationships. These databases are based on the mathematical notion of graphs, resulting in a more flexible representation of data than relational databases. This representation allows designing algorithms more efficiently to answer different kinds of questions using graph properties and traversal methods from graph theory.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, Neo4j has been chosen to illustrate the usage of graph databases, since it allows modeling and querying graph databases more easily. It uses the Cypher query language, which is optimised for pattern matching and graph exploration and combines it with built-in graph algorithms such as PageRank and shortest path. Unlike relational databases that rely on tables and JOIN operations, Neo4j uses a native graph structure that directly stores relationships, enabling faster and more scalable queries across networks.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j is used for a wide range of real-world applications such as fraud detection, where it identifies suspicious patterns by analyzing transaction graphs or in recommendation systems, where it leverages similarity and collaborative filtering to suggest products or content.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses a dataset of airport routes [3] to show how graph databases handle tasks that are more difficult for traditional databases, especially when analyzing connectivity, hubs, and optimal paths across complex networks."

    "The airport routes dataset showcases Neo4j’s real-world use case in transportation and logistics. It contains 3,503 airports and 46,389 flight routes. It enables getting information like shortest paths between cities and route optimization. This dataset is well suited for exploring network connectivity, route planning and airline performance analysis. \n"

    "Neo4j also presents important features. It is ACID compliant. Neo4j supports full-text indexing, which allows efficient search across textual properties. It may be useful for matching airport descriptions or names. Finally, Neo4j has schema flexibility. Users *can* define constraints, add properties at any time and you don't need to predefine a full-schema."

    "### Advantages and limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j’s biggest strength compared to relational databases is how it handles connected queries. In a relational database, queries that require exploring several layers of relationships (such as “find all airports reachable within three flights from Brussels”) require multiple JOIN operations. As the number of JOINs increases, the performance degrades, since each JOIN requires matching rows across large tables and scanning indexes. Neo4j, however, uses a native graph storage where relationships are stored as direct pointers between nodes. This makes multi-hop queries scale with the length of the path rather than with the number of records, which is a fundamental advantage when working with network structures. This means that algorithms such as shortest paths are executed in constant time relative to the number of hops, rather than degrading with dataset size. This will be shown in the last question of this notebook where we are showing how to execute the A* algorithm to find the shortest flight path. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another strength of Neo4j is the built-in functions like PageRank or community detection that are optimized to run directly inside the database engine, avoiding the overhead of exporting data into external analytics tools. This makes Neo4j particularly advantageous for real-time applications such as fraud detection, recommendation engines and route optimization, where speed is important. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cypher allows users to express graph queries using pattern matching instead of JOINs. Many complex relational queries become simpler and more readable when expressed as graph patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main drawback is that for flat, tabular or purely transactional data, relational databases often perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, because Neo4j stores relationships explicitly, datasets with extremely dense connectivity can consume more storage compared to normalized relational schemas.\n",

    "### Real-world use cases\n",
    "Because of its advantages, Neo4j is widely adopted in domains where data is highly interconnected. Here are some examples of use cases[7].\n",
    "- **Fraud Detection**: Traditional databases struggle to detect fraud patterns because they require slow JOIN operations to link indirect relationships. As Neo4j stores these relationships, it allows 1000 times faster query performance for detecting patterns. For example, Gilead Sciences uses Neo4j to combat huge pharmaceutical fraud [8].\n",
    "- **Life sciences problems**: As life sciences problems are graph problems (e.g., genes, proteins, and drugs), neo4j is naturally optimized for it. It allows to represent biological, chemical, and clinical data intuitively as well as accelerate discovery. AstraZeneca uses Neo4j [9] to build knowledge graphs and it allows researchers to identify potential drug targets that would be invisible in standard tables. \n",
    "- **Supply chain**: Like for the previous use cases, the supply chain's best representation is done with graph representation. the US army uses Neo4j to be able to effectively manage and analyze over 5 billion data nodes for equipment maintenance [10]. \n",
    "- **Recommendation engine**: While traditional engines often rely on pre-calculated data, Neo4j enables real-time recommendations by traversing the graphs instantly. Companies like eBay used Neo4j to personalize content based on user history and immediate behavior [11].\n"

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we explored Neo4j through geospatial data, using an airport network as a practical example. We went into the essential concepts of graph databases and showed how Neo4j's spatial features and indexing capabilities support efficient geolocation queries. \n",
    "By loading, structuring, and querying a dataset of airports, cities, countries, and flight routes, we proved the strengths of Neo4j for handling highly connected data, especially where relationships are as important as the entities themselves. The exercises illustrated both the simplicity of formulating basic graph queries and the expressiveness of more advanced ones that combine spatial reasoning with path traversal. \n",
    "We also examined a few of Neo4j’s graph algorithms, showing how they can be easily applied through the Graph Data Science library. Their implementation makes analysis efficient and accessible. \n",
    "Overall, the main lesson is that graph databases offer a natural and powerful way to work with complex, relationship-rich datasets, and Neo4j provides an intuitive environment for exploring such data at scale.\n",
