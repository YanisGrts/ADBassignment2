    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph databases have the particularity of representing data as nodes interconnected with edges, which respectively model entities and their relationships. These databases are based on the mathematical notion of graphs, resulting in a more flexible representation of data than relational databases. This representation allows to design algorithms more efficiently to answer different kinds of questions using graph properties and traversal methods from graph theory.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, Neo4j has been chosen to illustrate the usage of graph databases, since it allows to model and query graph databases more easily. It uses the Cypher query language, which is optimised for pattern matching and graph exploration  and combines it with already implemented graph algorithms such as PageRank and shortest path. Unlike relational databases that rely on tables and JOIN operations, Neo4j uses a native graph structure that directly stores relationships, enabling faster and more scalable queries across networks.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j is used for a wide range of real-world applications such as in fraud detection, where it identifies suspicious patterns by analysing transaction graphs or in recommendation systems, where it leverages similarity and collaborative filtering to suggest products or content.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses a dataset of airport routes [3] to show how graph databases handle tasks that are more difficult for traditional databases, especially when analyzing connectivity, hubs, and optimal paths across complex networks."

    "## Advantages and limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j’s biggest strength compared to relational databases is how it handles connected queries. In a relational database, exploring relationships requiring multiple entities (like “find all airports reachable within three flights from Brussels”) requires multiple JOINs across tables, and the cost of those JOINs grows rapidly as the dataset become bigger. Neo4j, however, uses a native graph storage where relationships are stored. This means that algorithms as shortest paths are executed in constant time relative to the number of hops, rather than degrading with dataset size. As a result, queries that would take seconds or minutes in SQL can often be executed much faster in Neo4j. This will be shown in the last question of this notebook where we are showing how to execute the A* algorithm to find the shortest flight path. \n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j also have built-in functions like PageRank or community detection that are optimised to run directly inside the database engine, avoiding the overhead of exporting data into external analytics tools. This makes Neo4j particularly advantageous for real-time applications such as fraud detection, recommendation engines and route optimisation, where speed is important. The main drawback is that for flat, tabular or purely transactional data, relational databases may still perform better.[4]\n",
